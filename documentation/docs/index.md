# ArchUnitNET

ArchUnitNET is a free, simple library for checking the architecture of C# code. It is the C# fork of [ArchUnit Java](https://www.archunit.org/) for Java. ArchUnitNET can check dependencies between
classes, members, interfaces, and more. This is done by analyzing C# bytecode and importing all classes into our C# code
structure. The main focus of ArchUnitNET is to automatically test architecture and coding rules.
